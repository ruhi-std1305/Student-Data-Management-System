# Student-Data-Management-System (C++)

##  Project Description  
The **Student Management System (SMS)** is a C++ console-based application designed to manage and organize student information efficiently.  
It allows administrators to add, search, update, delete, and display student records using core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.  
The system uses **linked lists** for dynamic data handling and provides a menu-driven interface for easy interaction.

##  Technologies Used  
- Programming Language: **C++**  
- Data Structures: **Linked List, Vector**  
- Interface: **Console-based**  
- Standard Library: iostream, iomanip, string, vector  

---

##  Features  
- Secure login system (admin authentication)  
- Add new student records  
- Display all student information by major  
- Search student by ID  
- Update student information  
- Delete student records  
- View available courses by department (CSE, EEE, CCE, Others)  
- Menu-driven user interface  

---

##  Data Structures Used  
- **Linked List**: To store and manage student records dynamically  
- **Vector**: To store available course lists for each department  
- **Struct & Classes**: To represent student and course data

##  How to Run  
1. Open the project in any C++ IDE (Code::Blocks / VS Code / CLion)  
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler  
3. Run the executable file  
4. Login using:  
   - Username: `admin`  
   - Password: `admin123`

---

##  Functionalities  
- Insert student data (ID, name, age, CGPA, major)  
- Automatically assign students to departments based on ID  
- Display formatted student tables  
- Perform update and delete operations  
- Display department-wise course lists

##  Future Enhancements  
- Add file handling for data persistence  
- Improve searching and sorting algorithms  
- Add duplicate record checking  
- Implement role-based login (admin/student)  
- Develop a GUI version of the system  
- Integrate with a database system

##  Conclusion  
The Student Management System demonstrates effective use of data structures for managing student records.  
It supports essential operations such as add, search, update, and delete while maintaining a simple and user-friendly interface.  
This project provides a strong foundation for building more advanced student information systems in the future.
